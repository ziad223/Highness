            <p className='text-gray-600'>
            At Highness Investment LLC, we believe that traders should be able to focus solely on trading and not have to worry about the security of their capital. With this in mind, we have taken extra steps to fulfill our obligations to our clients. One of these steps is the implementation of a Civil Liability insurance program that covers up to 2,500,000 EUR. Our program provides market-leading coverage against a range of risks, such as omissions, fraud, errors, and negligence, which could result in financial losses for our clients.

We are pleased to offer this coverage to our clients at no additional cost to them. Our goal is to provide our clients with peace of mind, knowing that their capital is protected while they focus on achieving their trading objectives.
